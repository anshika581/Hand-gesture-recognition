We have recognized hand gestures from a video sequence. To recognize these gestures from a live video sequence, we first  took out the hand region alone removing all the unwanted portions in the video sequence. After segmenting the hand region, we then counted the fingers shown in the video sequence. Thus, the entire problem is solved using 2 simple steps -
•Locating and segment the hand region from the video sequence.
•Identify segmented hand region in the video sequence and interpret it to words.
